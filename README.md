# 17947-di-sample-add-scheduled-videos
In this sample, you will learn how to schedule videos to become available at some future time, so that they aren't accidentally played before they should be.  Note that this sample is for accounts using the legacy ingest system. If your account uses the Dynamic Delivery system, see the Dynamic Delivery version instead.

This repository contains all the code for your convenience:
